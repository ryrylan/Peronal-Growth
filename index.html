        <p>Hi my name is Rylan and this is my <strong>first</strong> webpage!</p>
        <p>I hope to use this page along with <em>Git and GitHub</em> as a means of tracking my journey and progress with software development!</p>
        <p>This has been quite the exciting journey so far and I can not wait to see what else is in store. :)</p>
