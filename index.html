        <h1>My First Webpage!</h1>
        <p>Hi my name is Rylan and this is my <strong>first</strong> webpage!</p>

<!-- Adding in links to review the lesson -->

        <p>I hope to use this page along with <em>Git</em> and <a href="https://github.com/ryrylan/Peronal-Growth">GitHub</a> as a means of tracking my journey and progress with software development!</p>
        <p>This has been quite the exciting journey with <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> so far and I can not wait to see what else is in store. :)</p>

        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I am an 18 year old with high aspirations committed to a life of learning and creation.  I believe these things bring fulfillment to life and have therefore committed myself to a journey of continuously doing said things.</p>
        <p>Whether it be through the endless learning curve of coding or many of the other hobbies I have picked up along the way, my life has been a constant path of discovery; as I believe everyone's should be.</p>
